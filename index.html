            <p><strong>2005-2009:</strong> In 2005,alid was born into this world and lived through his baby years until 2009</p>
            <p><strong>2009-2017:</strong> In 2009, Alid entered preschool at SDN Guluk-Guluk 1 and in 2010-2011 he entered Kindergarten A-B at the same school and in 2012-2017 he entered elementary school up to grade 6, when he was in grade 1, Alid experienced typhus. and dengue fever so he was treated for 1 month at Pamekasan Hospital</p>
            <p><strong>2018-2020:</strong> in 2018 alid graduated from guluk-guluk 1 elementary school and continued his studies at the al-amien prenduan Islamic boarding school in 2018, at that time alid did not feel at home at the boarding school because he was thinking about his parents but eyebrows continued to defend his boarding school, but fate said differently in the following year Alid's parents experienced a domestic conflict which caused his parents to divorce. Alid, who heard this at the cottage, was immediately sad, cried uncontrollably, and with this conflict, Alid didn't feel at home for long at the cottage, not without reason, but people Alid's parents never visited him at the cottage and his parents already had their own families, at that time Alid was experiencing constant pain, eating badly, so his typhus came back again and had to be given an IV drip for 1 month, not just typhus. At that time, Alid also experienced typhus and kidney stones, thank God he was cured of his kidney stones but not his typhus and magh. After 2 years at the boarding house he didn't feel at home, one day he was slandered by theft which resulted in him becoming increasingly uncomfortable because heard the news that he was going to be expelled, but before that, Alid decided to quit the boarding school while saying goodbye to Mr. Kyai, and at that time he was unemployed for 1 year from school.</p>
            <p><strong>2020-2023:</strong> In 2020, Alid returned to junior high school in Annuqoyyah, but Alid did not like going to school there so Alid did not continue until graduation. Alid was again unemployed for 1 year in 2020 and 2021, Alid continued his schooling. going back to school at Ma Al-Muttahidah without a junior high school education, Alid continues to go to school there until now in 2024 and in less than a few months, Alid will graduate from that school and go to college, oh yes, by the way, Alid, in the 1st year of high school he experienced typhus again for 1 month</p>
            <p><strong>2024:</strong> and in 2024 he started learning coding starting from the mimo apk alid tried it, alid was just curious at first but now alid is even addicted and this is one of alid's projects that he has learned from yesterday</p>
